# ENTR

ENTR is a distribution of existing tools, frameworks, and standards, 
packaged together to accelerate the transition to clean energy. 

## Getting Started

1. Install Docker on your local developer machine. Your machine must support bash.
2. Run dev_build.sh to build your ENTR docker image. 'sh dev_build.sh'
3. Run dev_run.sh to run your ENTR docker image and log into Jupyter running NREL's OpenOA.
